# HabiTask 🏠✅ (From "Habitat" + "Task")
A seamless marketplace connecting property owners with skilled workers for repairs, renovations, and construction projects.

---

### **App Description**  

This app is a **marketplace platform** designed for two types of users: **Property Owners (Proprietors)** and **Workers (Contractors/Laborers)**.  

#### **User Roles & Features:**  

1. **Property Owners (Proprietors)**  
   - Search for properties and list them on the marketplace.  
   - If a property requires **construction, repair, or renovation**, they can create a **work request** specifying the type of work needed.  
   - Review worker applications and hire a suitable worker for the job.  
   - Manage their listed properties and ongoing work requests.  

2. **Workers (Contractors/Laborers)**  
   - Browse available work requests posted by property owners.  
   - Apply for jobs that match their skills (e.g., electrician, plumber, carpenter, painter, etc.).  
   - Complete assigned tasks and receive payments (either through the app or external means).  
   - Manage their job history and receive ratings from property owners.  

#### **Core Features:**  
✅ **User Authentication:** Sign up/login for both property owners and workers.  
✅ **Property Listings:** Owners can list, edit, and remove properties.  
✅ **Work Request System:** Owners can create job posts, and workers can apply for them.  
✅ **Job Management:** Track ongoing and completed work requests.  
✅ **User Profiles & Ratings:** Both owners and workers can view profiles and give feedback.  
✅ **Notifications:** Updates on job applications, approvals, and payments.

### **Prompt for React App Development**  

*"Develop a full-stack web application using React (JavaScript) for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. The application will be a **marketplace** connecting Property Owners and Workers. The frontend should have an intuitive UI, while the backend will manage authentication, job postings, user profiles, and notifications. The app should integrate Firebase or JWT for authentication, MongoDB for storing data, and Stripe for payments. The UI should include dashboards for both user roles, job listing pages, and real-time notifications. The system should allow property owners to post work requests and workers to apply for jobs. Additional features include in-app messaging, rating/reviews, and location-based job filtering."*

### **Prompt for Frontend Development (React, HTML, CSS, Tailwind)**  

*"Develop a responsive frontend UI for a property marketplace app using **React (JavaScript)** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The app should support two user roles: **Property Owners** and **Workers**.  

#### **Key Features to Implement:**  
✅ **Landing Page:** A visually appealing homepage introducing the platform.  
✅ **Authentication Pages:** Signup/Login forms (UI only, no backend logic).  
✅ **User Dashboards:**  
   - **Property Owner Dashboard:** Allows listing properties and posting work requests.  
   - **Worker Dashboard:** Displays available jobs and allows users to apply.  
✅ **Job Listings Page:** A page where workers can browse and filter job requests.  
✅ **Profile Pages:** Displays user details, job history, and ratings.  
✅ **Notifications UI:** Alerts for new job postings, applications, and status updates.  
✅ **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Fully responsive layout using **Flexbox & Grid**.  
✅ **Dark Mode Support (Optional)**: Implement a toggle switch for light/dark themes.  

The UI should follow a **modern and minimalistic** design with **smooth animations** (Framer Motion for subtle effects). Use **shadcn/ui** for pre-built components (buttons, cards, modals) and **Lucide-react** for icons. No backend integration—just static data for placeholders."*  

---

### **Prompt**  
This ensures the focus is purely on **frontend development** (HTML, CSS, and React components). It also specifies:  
✅ **Styling (Tailwind CSS)**  
✅ **UI Libraries (shadcn/ui, Lucide-react, Framer Motion)**  
✅ **Pages and Components**  
✅ **No backend logic required**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

- See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
